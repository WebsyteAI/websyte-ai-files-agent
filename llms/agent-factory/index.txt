## How to Use This Documentation

### For Beginners
If you're new to Cloudflare Agents, start with the [What Are Agents?](concepts/what-are-agents.txt) document to understand the core concepts. Then, explore the [Agents API Reference](concepts/agents-api-reference.txt) to learn about the Agent class and its capabilities.

### For Specific Use Cases
- **Building a chat bot**: Read the [AI Model Integration](code-snippets/ai-model-integration.txt) and [WebSocket Handling](code-snippets/websocket-handling.txt) sections, then use the Chat Agent template.
- **Creating a workflow automation**: Check out the [Scheduling Tasks](code-snippets/scheduling-tasks.txt) section and the Workflow Agent template.
- **Building a knowledge base agent**: Explore the [State Management](code-snippets/state-management.txt) section and the RAG Agent template.
- **Integrating with AI assistants**: Read the [MCP Integration](integration/mcp-integration.txt) section to learn how to build agents that expose tools and resources to AI models.

### For Deployment
When you're ready to deploy your agent, refer to the [Wrangler Configuration](configuration/wrangler-config.txt) document for detailed instructions on setting up your wrangler.jsonc file and configuring the necessary bindings.

## Key Capabilities of Cloudflare Agents

Agents built with the Cloudflare Agents SDK have several powerful capabilities:

1. **Stateful Computation**: Each agent instance has its own state that persists across requests and can be synchronized with clients.

2. **Real-time Communication**: Agents can communicate with clients in real-time using WebSockets, making them ideal for chat applications, collaborative tools, and live dashboards.

3. **AI Integration**: Agents can call AI models from various providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google's Gemini, and Cloudflare Workers AI.

4. **Task Scheduling**: Agents can schedule tasks to run in the future, enabling complex workflows, periodic checks, and delayed notifications.

5. **Database Access**: Each agent has its own SQLite database for storing and querying data efficiently.

6. **Scalability**: Agents can scale to millions of instances, each with its own isolated state and computation.

## Best Practices

1. **State Management**: Keep your agent's state well-structured and typed. Use TypeScript interfaces to define the shape of your state.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your agents, especially when calling external services or AI models.

3. **Streaming Responses**: For long-running operations like AI model calls, use streaming to provide a better user experience.

4. **Modular Design**: Break down complex agents into smaller, reusable components or methods.

5. **Testing**: Write tests for your agents to ensure they behave as expected in different scenarios.

6. **Security**: Validate inputs, use environment variables for secrets, and implement proper authentication and authorization.

## Examples

Each section includes practical code examples that you can adapt for your own agents. The templates section provides complete, ready-to-use agent implementations for common use cases.
